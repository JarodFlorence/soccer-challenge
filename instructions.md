## Python
No need to worry about additional installations to execute the solution. 

You can simply type `python solution.py sample-input.txt` to execute the solution or `python test_solution.py` to initiate the automated test. 

## TypeScript
Before jumping into anything, you'll need to install npm packages. Just hit `npm install` to load up packages such as `typescript`, `@types/node`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, and `@types/jest`.
Note that `jest.config.js` has been included to facilitate tests written in TypeScript.

Once you're ready, input `npm start` to fire up the solution, or go with `npm test` to set off the automated test.
